\abstract{
 Graph pattern matching with their vast number of cyclic foreign-key joins is a new challenge for data processing systems, like Spark, because their intermediary results grow over linear with regards to the inputs and are materialized by the traditionally used binary joins.
 Worst-case optimal join algorithms, WCOJ's, are a natural match to tackle this challenge because they do not materialize the aforementioned large intermediary results.
 We investigate two major open questions regarding WCOJ's.
 First, we develop a WCOJ specialized to graph-pattern matching, namely self-joins on a relationship with two attributes, and compare its performance with a general WCOJ.
 Second, we propose a novel method to distribute WCOJ's. 
 We show in our proposal that current methods to distribute WCOJ's, suitable for Spark, do not scale well to bigger graph pattern (five vertices and more).
 Based on this result we propose to keep the edge relationship cached on all workers but distribute the computation using a logical partitioning.
 Along the line of argumentation in COST~\cite{cost}, we aim to provide a fast WCOJ implementation in Spark which scales well in use of computational resources by trading off scalability in memory usage.
 This is a reasonable trade-off as most graphs today fit in main memory~\cite{snap}. % TODO also cite position paper from Sahihoglus colleague here
 Our thesis provides the first distributed, open-source implementation of a WCOJ in a data processing system widely used in industry, namely Spark.
